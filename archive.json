Consumer wants to know, is artifact trustworthy; check the trust registry for trust declarations for artifact\r\n3. Assuming a process will exist to populate the trust registry with trust declarations for the artifact\r\n4. Process will need a \"trusted party\" to determine that artifact is trustworthy, using a defined process and criteria that are intended to validate/confirm the trustworthiness of an artifact based on evidence collected/produced.\r\n5. Trusted party determines that a trust declaration is warranted, based on the defined process and criteria\r\n6. Trusted party requests registration of a trust declaration in the trusted registry for the now trusted artifact\r\n7. Registration is confirmed in the trust registry via a positive acknowledgement that the entry is stored in the registry\r\n8. Trusted party  that performed the process resulting in the registration of a trust declaration informs the artifact owner that the artifact has been registered as trustworthy in the SCITT trust registry \r\n9. Artifact owner informs interested parties on how to check a SCITT trust registry  for trustworthiness of an artifact\r\n10. Interested parties query the SCITT Trust Registry for trust declarations for an artifact, using information provided by the artifact owner\r\n11.

However, the range of use cases and applications in this document is much broader, which requires much more flexibility in how each TS implements and operates its ledger. Each service may enforce its own policy for authorizing entities to register their claims on the TS. Some TS may also enforce access control policies to limit who can audit the full ledger, or keep some information on the ledger encrypted. Nevertheless, it is critical to provide global interoperability for all TS instances as the composition and configuration of involved supply chain entities and their system components is ever changing and always in flux.\r\n```",

We think that most of the costs associated with the implementation and operation of SCITT servers are related to the **persistence and distribution/querying of the ledger** rather than its actual computation. For instance, it is possible to implement a minimal append-only ledger using a single hash (like PCRs in TPMs), which technically meets the requirements of append-only and consistent/fork-free. The implementation overhead for such a ledger is only the computation of an extra hash per claim and the persistence of a single hash value in addition to the receipt signing key, while the benefit is a much stronger a clearly defined security goal for SCITT verifiers. I would like to check there is consensus for this change before it is approved.",

If the policy of the TS evolves over time, or is different across issuers, the guarantee derived from receipt validation may not be uniform across all claims over time.\r\n```",
